# Eric Altenburg \hfill CS-555 \hfill \today
## Week 3

#. Waterfall Model
	- Model doesn't work with a project that has lots of changes
#. Customer Chaos Model
	- Too many customers asking devs for stuff
	- Loudest voice wins
#. Assumptions of _empirical methods_
	- Can't repeat process from input to output due to variables and noise (unpredictable)
	- Management consists of constantly monitoring and adapting
#. Scrum process
	- Prioritizes certain user stories to be implemented
	- Sprint planning
	- Sprint backlog (what team wants to implement)
	- Sprint execution (1-2 weeks implementing feature)
		- Daily scrum (meeting to report progress)
	- Potentially shippable product increment (what was done in the sprint)
	- Sprint review (team + product owner + customer + stakeholders look at output of sprint)
	- Sprint Retrospective (take feedback from review and see how to improve)
 #. Scrum Roles
 	- Stakeholders
 		- Internal stakeholders (CEOs etc.)
 		- Customers/users (must organize user stories by priority)
 		- Product owner (Represents customers)
	- Scrum Team
 		- Scrum master (helps dev team with scrum practices and helps the product owner)
 		- Dev team (3-10 members in one location, chooses their own roles [not boss])
 		- Product owner (Must "OK" the products before release)
#. Examples
	- Small Start-up
		- One scrum team for one project
		- Roles:
			- Product owner
			- Dev team
			- Scrum master
	- Mid-sized
		- Many scrum teams with indep. projects
		- Roles:
			- Stakeholders
			- Product owner
			- Dev team
			- Scrum masters
	- Large multi-national
		- Many scrum teams divided on one large project
		- Roles:
			- Stakeholders
			- Product owner
			- Dev team
			- Scrum master

#. Backlogs
	- Product backlogs (stakeholders + dev team can add to this)
		- User stories should be DEEP (detailed, emergent, estimated, prioritized)
		- Product owners prioritize items
		- Devs estimate items
	- Release backlogs (product owners add to this because they represent the customers)
		- Subset of product backlog
	- Sprint backlogs (features to be completed for next sprint)
		- Subset of release backlog
