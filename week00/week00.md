<!--- ## Week 1 Readings

### \quad Boehm 2002 — Agile Methods

- Traditional:
	- extensive planning, codified processes, rigorous reuse to make dev an efficient and predictable activity
- New Generation:
	- Cites corporate bureaucracy, rapid pace of information technology change, and dehumanizing effects of detailed plan-driven development for change in development
	- Wants to get rid of everything that isn't essential
- Keeping up with change is necessary but overdoing the change isn't good either
- Maybe a combined approach?
- \textbf{The planning spectrum}
	- Agile methods place more value on planning process than the resulting documentation
